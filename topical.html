            For the first step we chose three personas with different
            characteristics. The base for choosing these personas was to make them
            as unique as possible, trying to avoid stereotypes and our own
            characteristics as well. These are the three different personas we made
            for the first step:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Persona 1 is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language" class="lenker">Germany</a>
                with an African ethnicity. This persona is a
                38-year-old wheelchair user, a female with a master’s degree.
            </li>
            <li>
                Persona 2 is from Norway with a Sami ethnicity. This persona is a 70-year- old deaf man. He has no
                degree or level of education
            </li>
            <li>
                Persona 3 is from the Philippines with a mixed ethnicity of native
                filipino and hispanic. This persona is a 21-year-old female, and has
                only one arm. She has a high school education.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Further on, we picked the one that seemed the most different from all
            of us in the group. This is Persona 3’s life. We chose Maria Cruz
            because of certain similarities with our own lives, but at the same
            time, vastly different obstacles in everyday life. The ability to both
            see similarities, but at the same time emphasize with differences makes
            it approachable to relate to this person.

        <p>
            Maria Cruz is a 21-year-old hispanic filipino living in the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" class="lenker">United States</a>
            for her exchange year on MiT. She is currently living in Boston with three
            other exchange students from other countries. The rest of her family is
            still living in the Philippines and she has regular contact with them.
            When it comes to modern technology, it can be challenging for Maria to use
            computers since computers are an essential part of modern life. She often
            experiences barriers in relation to the design and functionality of this
            technology. Here are ten examples of Maria’s barriers in the daily life with
            computer technology:
        </p>
        <ol class="mellomrom-setning">
            <li>Taking notes in class on the computer, can’t write fast enough</li>
            <li>Typing and moving mouse at the same time</li>
            <li>Getting the computer from a bag</li>
            <li>Opening the computer with only one hand</li>
            <li>Plugging in charger and cables</li>
            <li>Understanding how to upgrade her stationary PC manually</li>
            <li>Websites without translation makes it difficult without a great knowledge of english</li>
            <li>Games on computers typically need two hands</li>
            <li>Difficulty with using keyboard shortcuts</li>
            <li>Too many distractions on the keyboard</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            With some small adjustments these barriers can easily be solved. We’ve looked at a couple of them below:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Solutions to the barrier of taking notes in the classroom could be recording devices on the computer.
                Speech to text program
            </li>
            <li>Joystick feature with options to both move and type on a digital keyboard</li>
            <li>The zip-lock with one hand could be solved by a different type of opening and locking the bag. One
                solution could be velcro,
                even though velcro would not be as safe for keeping the items within the bag
            </li>
            <li>Opening the computer with one hand is possible though it is more difficult. Tablets could be a
                solution
            </li>
            <li>Wireless or magnetic charging could be implemented to computers to make it less of a hassle</li>
            <li>All new components could be made to be color coded with PC’s to see where the newly bought parts belong,
                this would streamline
                the upgrading process and generally make it easier to understand the inside of your PC
            </li>
            <li>Computer applications that automatically translate websites can be improved to make its translations
                more precise
            </li>
            <li>Games could integrate a “one-hand-mode”, where they could use a type of eye-tracker so that only one
                hand would be necessary to play
                the game
            </li>
            <li>Easier shortcuts will be the solution for this problem. We can do this by customizing the keyboard with
                custom shortcuts
            </li>
            <li>Easier design made as a one-handed keyboard, fewer buttons but the same functions (see: evolution of tv
                remote controls). Touch
                screen is another solution for this problem
            </li>
